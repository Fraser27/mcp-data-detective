            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>The analysis of the e-commerce sales data reveals that the top-selling products are primarily in the Electronics and Furniture categories, with the "Laptop Pro" being the highest-selling item. However, the overall number of sales is relatively low, with most products having only a single unit sold.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Key Insights</h2>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="topProductsChart"></canvas>
            </div>
            <p>The key insights from the data analysis are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The "Laptop Pro" is the top-selling product, generating $1,299.99 in sales from a single unit sold, suggesting it is a high-ticket item.</li>
                <li>The Electronics and Furniture categories dominate the top-selling products, with 4 out of the top 7 products belonging to these categories.</li>
                <li>Most products have only a single unit sold, indicating a low overall number of orders or a limited product selection.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Business Impact</h2>
            <p>The low number of total sales and the concentration of sales in a few high-ticket items suggest potential issues with the e-commerce business. The limited product selection and lack of repeat purchases may indicate a need to expand the product catalog and improve customer engagement.</p>

            <h2>Immediate Action Items</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Analyze the factors contributing to the high sales of the "Laptop Pro" and consider expanding the product line in the Electronics category.</li>
                <li>Investigate ways to increase the number of orders and encourage repeat purchases, such as targeted marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, or improving the overall customer experience.</li>
                <li>Expand the product selection, especially in the Furniture and Office Supplies categories, to cater to a wider range of customer needs.</li>

            <h2>Risk Mitigation</h2>
            <p>The concentration of sales in a few high-ticket items and the low overall number of sales pose risks to the long-term sustainability of the e-commerce business. To mitigate these risks, the business should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Diversify the product portfolio to reduce reliance on a single or few high-value items.</li>
                <li>Implement customer retention strategies to increase repeat business and build a loyal customer base.</li>
                <li>Continuously monitor sales trends and customer behavior to identify and address any emerging issues or opportunities.</li>
